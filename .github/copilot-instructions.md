# AI Trading Platform - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a cutting-edge AI-powered trading platform built with:
- React + TypeScript + Vite for fast development
- Tailwind CSS v4 for premium dark theme styling
- Three.js & React Three Fiber for 3D visualizations
- GSAP + Framer Motion for cinematic animations
- Real-time WebSocket data integration
- Premium fintech UI with glassmorphism effects

## Key Features to Maintain
- Dark theme with premium fintech aesthetics (TradingView, Binance style)
- 3D visualizations for market data and portfolio
- Real-time price feeds and AI trading signals
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- WebGL-powered charts and data visualization
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Architecture Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement custom hooks for data fetching
- Follow atomic design principles for components
- Use Zustand for state management
- Optimize Three.js scenes for performance
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Styling Guidelines

- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy load Three.js components
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Use React.memo for heavy components
- Implement proper WebSocket cleanup
- Optimize chart rendering with requestAnimationFrame
